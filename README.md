# Combining-Cognitive-Modeling-and-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Clarification-in-Dialogue
In many domains, dialogue systems need to work collaboratively with users to successfully reconstruct the meaning the user had in mind. In this paper, we show how cognitive models of users’ communicative strategies can be leveraged in a reinforcement learning approach to dialogue planning to enable interactive systems to give targeted, effective feedback about the system’s understanding. We describe a prototype system that collaborates on reference tasks that distinguish arbitrarily varying color patches from similar distractors, and use experiments with crowd workers and analyses of our learned policies to document that our approach leads to context-sensitive clarification strategies that focus on key missing information, elicit correct answers that the system understands, and contribute to increasing dialogue success.
# Instructions
System was tested and run with python 3.6. Install the requirements.txt file and the run the 'app.py' file to start the task server at localhost. It loads the pre-trained multi clarification model by default.
