    "## A* decoding and language modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Matthew Stone, CS 533, Spring 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a homework assignment: it asks to you to extend and adapt the $A^*$ segmentation code explained in class to do vowel restoration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This file demonstrates and explains the use of generic search techniques for decoding using a language model.  The code is based on an implementation of A$^*$ search, which generalizes in interesting ways to other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A$^*$ search is a generic search method that provably finds the least-cost solution to a specified problem.  It assumes that you have two bits of information about a partial solution: you know the cost that you've incurred so far, and you have a heuristic which gives a lower bound on the cost you still have to incur to flesh it out into a complete solution.  By combining the cost and the heuristic, A$^*$ explores only the parts of the search space that look at least as good as the best solution.  In cases where the heuristic function provides a tight lower bound and no suboptimal steps need to be taken in the course of the search, A$^*$ only explores states that are part of optimal paths.  Wikipedia has [a comprehensive introduction to A$^*$][1].  You can also find [good visualizations of A$^*$][2], especially for path planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To think of segmentation as search, you can think of the decoding problem as finding the shortest path in an abstract graph.  The vertices in the graph correspond to hypotheses that explain the input symbols up to position $j$ and ending in word $w$.  When the search process reaches one of these vertices, it finds the best path ending in $(j, w)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The analogy between probability and path planning depends on thinking of the cost of a path as its negative log probability.  By working with log probabilities rather than probabilities, we make the score associated with a path the sum of the scores associated with each edge.  We use negative log probabilities to make more likely steps smaller (since each step represents something that happens only a fraction of the time, log probabilities themselves are negative numbers, with strongly negative numbers representing extremely unlikely outcomes).\n",

    "$A^*$ depends on a special priority queue data structure.  We need to be able to do a number of operations efficiently:\n",
    "* Find the node with the least cost so far.  This is an essential operation of any priority queue.\n",
    "* Add a new node to the queue with a specified priority.  Ditto.\n",
    "* Find a record indicating the status of a state in the queue.  We need to answer whether there's already a node for this state in the queue, and find out what priority it currently has, and we also need to be able to tell whether we've explored a node for this state already.\n",
    "* Replace the node for a given state with a different node with a new path and a lower priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally doing all these things efficiently and with a minimal amount of space requires some pointer manipulation that python doesn't easily support.  So the standard way of achieving this functionality in python is to use extra memory and amortize the costs of reprioritizing nodes by marking nodes as redundant (rather than deleting them) and then ignoring them at removal time.  There's a good explanation of the basic idea [in the python documentation][1].  This code is modified from there to add a bit of object-oriented cleanliness and to make explicit the distinction in $A^*$ between states and nodes, and between costs, heuristics, and priorities.\n",

The treatment of history information in $A^*$ nodes is one of those cases.  The same path history needs to be able to grow efficiently into the paths for all of its children.  That basically rules out list structures in python; fast updates to a list will affect everybody; but copying lists is an operation that's linear time in the length of the input string.

    "\n",
    "The essence of a heuristic function in $A^*$ search is to find a quantity that tracks the lowest cost that could possibly be incurred in completing a partial solution to the search problem.  In the case of vowel restoration, a partial solution will say how the first $k$ tokens should be transformed into valid words with vowels.  The heuristic should therefore track the best possible cost that might be incurred in transforming the words at position $k+1$ through the end of the string.  It's complicated to compute that cost exactly, but you do know that at every step, you have to transition between one of the possible words at position $k$ to one of the possible words at position $k+1$.   So you can get a heuristic function by taking the smallest possible cost for each of these transitions (without worrying about whether the word you transition to at $k+1$ in turn allows the best possible transition to position $k+2$ etc).\n",

    "Write a function `compute_heuristics` that takes as input the kind of list produced by `expand`: a specification of the set of possible reconstructed words at each position.   Return a list of heuristic values that should be one item longer than the input list.  In the output, the value at position $k$ should be the sum of the best scores from each position to the next, starting from the transition to position $k$ and continuing up to the end of the string.  Thus, if the length of the input is $n$, the value at position $n$ should be 0, the value at position $n-1$ should be the best score from position $n-2$ to $n-1$, the value at position $n-2$ should be the best score from position $n-3$ to $n-2$ plus the best score from position $n-2$ to $n-1$, and so forth, all the way back to the beginning of the string, when you use `None` as the preceding word to factor in the best unigram probability for the initial word at position $0$.

The point of the heuristic is that it should be fast to calculate (without having to do a search that's anywhere near as complicated as the overall problem) but still give a good bound on the solution quality.  In a tagging problem, once you've tagged the words up to position $j$, what you have left to do is to tag the words from position $j+1$ through to the end of the string (and supply the extra `END` token at the end).  That will occur some cost because of the transitions that you have to use, and exactly what that will be is going to be hard to figure out.  But you know at each step that you will have to incur at least the most likely word-word transition anywhere. Since there's no dependence on the word chosen, just on the index, you know you're going to need all of the heuristic values to solve the problem and you can just store them all in advance as needed."
